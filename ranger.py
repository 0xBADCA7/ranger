#   source ranger ranger
# Now when you quit ranger, it should change the directory of the

# Works with at least bash and zsh.
#
# A convenient way of using this feature is adding this line to your bashrc:
#   alias rn='source ranger ranger'
# or, if ranger is not installed properly:
#   alias rn='source /path/to/ranger.py /path/to/ranger.py'
