Installing
==========

Use the package manager of your operating system to install ranger.

To install ranger manually, use either:
sudo ./setup.py install --optimize=1 --record=uninstall_info

or for short:
sudo make install


Uninstalling
============

Ranger uses python distutils to install ranger which does not support automatic
uninstalling.

However, after installing ranger with one of the ways above, all installed
files are recorded to "uninstall_info".  This information can be used to
remove ranger:
cat uninstall_info | xargs -d "\n" sudo rm --

or simply:
sudo make uninstall
