# ===================================================================
# This file contains startup commands for ranger.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings.  For
# changing settings or running more complex python code, use the
# configuration file "options.py" or define commands in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely on
# the UI such as "delete" or "mark".  Lines starting with # are comments.
# Refer to the man page or press 2? in ranger for a list of commands.
# ===================================================================

#map gc cd ~/.config
