# ===================================================================
# This file contains startup commands for ranger.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings.  For
# changing settings or running more complex python code, use the
# configuration file "options.py" or define commands in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely on
# the UI such as :delete or :mark.  Lines starting with # are comments.
# ===================================================================

# common directories (this overrides some default keybindings)
#map gt cd /tmp
#map gc cd ~/.config
#map gp cd /usr/portage

# Unbind "q" so you don't accidentally close ranger
#unmap q

# Edit files with the lowercase "e".  By default, uppercase "E" is used.
#copymap E e

# Add a key for searching files with a given string in their name
#map F console shell -p find . | grep -Iinr --color 

# Find all files in this directory, shuffle them and view in mplayer
#map M shell find . | shuf | xargs -d \\n mplayer -fs
