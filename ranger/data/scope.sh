# This script is called whenever you preview a file.
# Its output is used as the preview.  ANSI color codes are supported.

# NOTES: This script is considered a configuration file.  If you upgrade
# ranger, it will be left untouched. (You must update it yourself)
# NEVER make this script interactive. (by starting mplayer or something)

# Meanings of exit codes:
# code | meaning    | action of ranger
# -----+------------+-------------------------------------------
# 0    | success    | display stdout as preview
# 1    | no preview | display no preview at all
# 2    | plain text | display the plain content of the file
# 3    | fix width  | success. Don't reload when width changes
# 4    | fix height | success. Don't reload when height changes
# 5    | fix both   | success. Don't ever reload

# Meaningful aliases for arguments:
path="$1"    # Full path of the selected file
width="$2"   # Width of the preview pane (number of fitting characters)
height="$3"  # Height of the preview pane (number of fitting characters)
