"""
Ranger has the same, or similar movement keys as vim:

	k    move up
	j    move down
	h    move left (in browser: move one directory up)
	l    move right (in browser: enter this directory, or start this file)

	K    move half the screen up
	J    move half the screen down
	H    in browser: move back in history
	L    in browser: move forward in history

	gg   move to the top
	G    move to the bottom

By prefixing a number, you can give more precise commands, eg:

	2J   move 2 pages down
	5gg  move to the 5th line
	3h   move 3 characters to the left, or move 3 directories up

Special keys like Home, Page Up,.. work as expected.
