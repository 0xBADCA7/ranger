.TH RANGER 1 ranger-1.0.4
.SH NAME
ranger - file manager with a high range overview
.\"-----------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ranger
.R [OPTIONS] [FILE]
.\"-----------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
ranger is a file manager with an ncurses frontend that is designed for
smooth interaction with the human visual interface and compatibility with
the muscle memory of individuals with long term exposure to common CLI tools
of unix-like operating systems.
.\"-----------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
--version
Print the version and exit.
.TP
-h, --help
Print a list of options and exit.
.TP
-d, --debug
Activate the debug mode:  Whenever an error occurs, ranger will exit and
print a full backtrace.  The default behaviour is to merely print the
name of the exception in the statusbar/log and to try to keep running.
.TP
-c, --clean
Activate the clean mode:  Ranger will not access or create any configuration
files nor will it leave any traces on your system.  This is useful when
your configuration is broken, when you want to avoid clutter, etc.
.TP
-r \fIdir\fR, --confdir=\fIdir\fR
Define a different configuration directory.  The default is $HOME/.ranger.
.TP
-m \fIn\fR, --mode=\fIn\fR
When a filename is supplied, make it run in mode \fIn\fR. Check the
documentation for more information on modes.
.TP
-f \fIflags\fR, --flags=\fIflags\fR
When a filename is supplied, make it run with the flags \fIflags\fR. Check the
documentation for more information on flags.

non-empty directories.

to a file name.

.SH TIPS
.SS
Change the directory after exit
A script like this in your bashrc would make you change the directory
of your parent shell after exiting ranger:
.nf

ranger() {
    $(which ranger) $@ &&
    cd "$(grep \\^\\' ~/.ranger/bookmarks | cut -b3-)"
}
.\"-----------------------------------------
.SH CONFIGURATION
The files in
.B ranger/defaults/
can be copied into your configuration directory (by default, this is
$HOME/.ranger) and customized according to your wishes.  
.B ranger/defaults/options.py
doesn't have to be copied completely though: Just define those settings
you want to change and they will override the default values.
Colorschemes can be placed in $HOME/.ranger/colorschemes.
.P
All configuration is done in Python.
Each configuration file should contain sufficient documentation.
