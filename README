Ranger v.1.0.4
==============

Ranger is a file manager offering fast and straightforward navigation.
By efficiently using the display space, it gives you a broad overview of
your file system.  Ranger's hotkeys are similar to those of other common
unix programs such as VIM, Emacs and Midnight Commander, though it's
controllable with Arrow Keys just fine.

The program is written in Python (2.6 or 3.1) and uses curses for the
text-based user interface.

Getting Started
---------------

Ranger can be started without installing.  Just run the executable (in
a terminal.)  The switch "--clean" will prevent it from creating or
accessing configuration files.

Follow the instructions in the INSTALL file for installing ranger.

After starting ranger, you should see 4 columns. The third one is the main
column, the directory where you're currently at.  To the left you see the
parent directories and to the right there's a preview of the object you're
pointing at.  Now use the Arrow Keys to navigate, Enter to open a file
or type Q to quit.

To customize ranger, copy the files from ranger/defaults/ to ~/.ranger/
and modify them according to your wishes.


Troubleshooting, Getting Help
-----------------------------

If you encounter an error, try running ranger with --debug.  This will
sometimes display more detailed information about the error.  Also, try
deactivating optimization:

PYTHONOPTIMIZE="" ranger --debug
