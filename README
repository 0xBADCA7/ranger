== Ranger v.1

Ranger is a filemanager that integrates well into the linux shell and
gives you a quick way of doing operations that would otherwise require
a lot of typing, without starting up a bloated environment.

Ranger is written in Ruby and uses ncurses for the user interface.

The version 1 is a rewrite from scratch and offers very limited
functionality as of now.
