Ranger v.1.0.3
==============

Ranger

   A keeper, guardian, or soldier who ranges over a region
   to protect the area or enforce the law.

Need a fast way of navigating in your shell?  Hate ugly graphical
environments?  Try this console-based filemanager!

The multi-column display shows a range of the filesystem, giving you
a large part of the directory tree to work with, rather than restricting
you to the current directory only.  Preview the content of the selected
file or directory, copy or move files around with the VIM-like commands
dd and yy, execute predefined applications when opening a file, etc...

Everything is fully customizable and written in Python (2.6 and 3.1
compatible) using curses for the user interface.

Alternatively you can send an email to romanz@lavabit.com.

Please include as much relevant information as possible.
Using ranger with the --debug option will abort the program and
print tracebacks rather than a red message in the statusbar.
If this applies to you, please include such a traceback in your report.


Getting Started
---------------

At first, it's a good idea to create a symlink in your bin dir:
    sudo ln -s /path/to/ranger.py /usr/bin/ranger

Now type in ranger to start it.

You should see 4 columns.  The third is the directory where you are at
the moment.  To the left, there are the directories above the current
working directory, and the column on the right is a preview of the selected
file/directory.

Now use the arrow keys to navigate, press enter to open a file.

A list of commands with short descriptions can be viewed by
pressing "?" inside the program and following the instructions.
The file code/keys.rb contains all key combinations, so that's another
place you may want to check out.
More extensive documentation will be written when enough users ask me to :)


Opening Files with Ranger
-------------------------

If you use the same applications like me, you'll be able to open
files by pressing the right arrow key.  If not, you will have to
specify them in ranger/defaults/apps.py.  It's explained
in the docstrings how exactly to do that.

Once you've set up your applications, you can also use ranger to
open files from the shell:
    ranger blabla.pdf


Customizing Ranger
------------------

The file ranger/defaults/options.py contains most of the options.
apps.py defines how files are run, keys.py defines keybindings.

The files in ranger/defaults/ can be copied into ~/.ranger/ for per-user
modifications.  Colorschemes can be placed in ~/.ranger/colorschemes.

The configuration files should be self-explanatory.  If you need more
information, check out the source code.

Also, see the file HACKING for more detailed instructions on
modifying the program.
