Guidelines on Code Modification
===============================

Coding Style
------------

* Use syntax compatible to both python 2.6 and 3.1.
* Use docstrings with pydoc in mind
* Follow the style guide for python code:
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* Although this guide suggests otherwise, tabs are used for indentation
    of code and docstrings.  In other documents (readme, etc), use spaces.


Patches
-------

Send patches, created with "git format-patch", to the email adress

    hut@lavabit.com

If you plan to do major changes, or many changes over time, I encourage
you to create a fork on GitHub or Gitorious.


Common Changes
--------------

* Change which files are previewed in the auto preview:
In ranger/gui/widget/browsercolumn.py
the constant PREVIEW_BLACKLIST

* Adding options:
In ranger/defaults/options.py
add the default value, like: my_option = True
In ranger/shared/settings.py
add the name of your option to the constant ALLOWED_SETTINGS

The setting is now accessible at self.settings.my_option,
assuming <self> is a "SettingsAware" object.

* Change commands:
ranger/commands.py

* Create aliases for commands:
In ranger/commands.py
at the bottom, write something like: alias(exit=quit)

* Adding colorschemes:
Copy ranger/colorschemes/default.py to ranger/colorschemes/myscheme.py
and modify it according to your needs.
In ranger/defaults/options.py, change
    colorscheme = colorschemes.default
to: colorscheme = colorschemes.myscheme

* Change which files are considered to be "hidden":
In ranger/defaults/options.py
change the hidden_filter regular expression.

* Change the key map:
Modify ranger/defaults/keys.py.  This should be self-explanatory.
Check out ranger/actions.py for the most common actions, of course
you can also use your own functions.

* Change the file type => application associations:
In ranger/defaults/apps.py
modify the method app_default.
The variable "f" is a filesystem-object with attributes like mimetype,
extension, etc.  For a full list, check ranger/fsobject/fsobject.py

* Change the file extension => mime type associations:
Modify ranger/data/mime.types
and run ranger/data/generate.py to compile it.


Version Numbering
-----------------

X.Y.Z, where:

* X: Milestones
* Y: Stable versions
* Z: Experimental versions
