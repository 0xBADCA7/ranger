	Oh no. I neglegted to write change logs... in a nutshell, i changed:
	New Hotkey: [r]...flags...[r] which runs the selected file with flags
	like [d] to detach the process or [t] to run it in a seperate terminal
	For that I also changed Action.run()

	Minor changes to the way directories and file infos are read
		entries are not instantly scheduled upon encounter
	Rewritten "ascend" method, which uses Action::run() now (still theres a lot
	to be done)
	Directory::entry#mimetype() instead of Fm.MIMETYPES[Directory::entry#ext()]
